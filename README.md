1. How do I approach designing software?
  * What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      I am now able to look at objects in the real world and piece them together to create a 3D visualization.
  * What design process did you follow for your project work?
      Throughout this course, I had a final goal in mind. Each module built upon the last and the final result was eventually realized. This is an iterative design process, as each week included one or two new objects or concepts.
  * How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      I generally try to complete a project in the first iteration, with each update improving upon an already existing part of it. Using an iterative design process, however, decreases the amount of time required to put out a new feature and I will definitely be using this in the future. 

2. How do I approach developing programs?
  * What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      There are quite a few new strategies that I used when working on this scene, but the biggest one is modularization. While this isn't necessarily a new development strategy, this is the first project that I feel I completely modularized my program.
  * How did iteration factor into your development?
      Iteration is a huge part of my project. I used iteration for the generation of vertices, indices, and even for creating weighted normals for specular lighting.
  * How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
      Initially, I went straight to writing code without much though of how it would be laid out. As the course progressed and the code became more complicated, I started top think about how to lay out the code to create less refactoring of the code in the future.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      Regardless of whether I will use OpenGL in future courses, I learned a lot about libraries and modularization in this course that I will continue to use throughout my educational journey.
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
      I hope work in game development one day, and I have worked on minor game development projects as a hobby. It is incredibly useful to know how objects are rendered on screen and what the values and parameters are for and how they are being used.
